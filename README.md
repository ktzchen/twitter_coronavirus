# Coronavirus twitter analysis

## Background

Approximately 500 million tweets are sent everyday.
Of those tweets, about 1% are *geotagged*.
That is, the user's device includes location information about where the tweets were sent from.
In this project, I used a dataset containing all the geotagged tweets that were sent in 2020 to monitor for the spread of coronavirus on social media.
In total, there are about 1.1 billion tweets in this dataset.

## Repo Information

The `viz` folder contains the fully organized and visualized data. The `lang` and `country` folders contain respectively data organized by language of the tweet and country of origin. Within these folders, the data is organized by hashtags of interest that were related to coronavirus. The data is visualized by showing the number of times a certain hashtag was used. 

## Skills Practiced

1. work with large scale datasets
1. work with multilingual text
1. use the MapReduce divide-and-conquer paradigm to create parallel code
